Everyone knows that dogs desire the company of their pack, and cats are independent creatures with no interest in socializing. Right?

Unfortunately, this is not completely correct. Cats can be just as social as dogs, with some individuals craving just as much attention as their canine counterparts. This fact becomes very important when you have to go out of town on business, or decide to plan that much needed getaway. 

While most dog owners confirm their pet care arrangements way in advance, many people travel without giving a second thought as to who will care for their cats in their absence.  They believe that their cats will be fine on their own, and won’t miss the human contact and regular daily routine.

Most cats have a need for companionship and love on a daily basis. Even the scaredy-cats that hide most of the time do better when they have someone actively caring for them.  Leaving your kitty home by herself is a big adjustment for her.  Cats are very dependent on their routine, and when things change, they become stressed out. Kitties that are left to fend for themselves can also become depressed and bored.

Stress and boredom can have many adverse effects on our feline friends. Think about all the things that can happen while you are gone:


  - A bored kitty might decide to shred your new drapes, or “decorate” your favorite armchair with claw marks.  Not something you want to come home to after a long day of travel. 

  - Stress can cause your cat to stop eating. This may seem benign, but cats have very unique digestive systems. When they do not eat for more than a few days, they can develop serious liver problems, which can be fatal. 
 
 - Stress can also cause litter box issues for cats. This can cause inflammation in the bladder, which results in pain during urination. Cats begin to urinate outside the box, because they associate the litter box with pain. 

  - Male cats are particularly prone to a life-threatening urinary blockage. This can happen suddenly, without any prior symptoms. If your kitty was left alone for more than 24 hours, and happened to develop this condition, there could be deadly consequences. 

Don’t forget about your kitty’s feelings. Think about how sad she may be without her people around. She will miss interacting with her favorite humans while you are away.

Once or twice daily visits are essential to ensure the health and safety of your kitty. Cats can get themselves into all kinds of trouble without someone to supervise them. Leaving Kitty alone for days at a time can lead to serious issues that may not be found until it’s too late.

Daily visits allow us to check on your cat, making sure she has not injured herself. We can make sure the litter box is being used, and can check for litter box issues. We can give your kitty fresh food and water at each visit, and make sure that she is eating and drinking normally. We will spend quality time with your kitty, giving much-needed attention and TLC. Petting, brushing, and a short session with the laser pointer or feather toy will make sure that your kitty gets the playtime and human interaction she desires.
